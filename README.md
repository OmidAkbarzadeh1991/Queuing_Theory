# Analyzing the network system performance based on the queuing theory concept
# Project Summery
Increasing network use in several domains makes
optimization more critical than ever before. The Queuing theory
is used to comprehend the networkâ€™s performance by comparing
various factors to determine the optimal design based on the
number of servers and distribution in order to maximize packet
transmission and decrease packet loss. The result illustrates that
uniform service time distribution, as opposed to an exponential
distribution, may reduce packet loss. In addition, the behavior
of packet transmission is depicted using servers with varying
waiting line capacities. This study compares M/M/1, M/M/1/B,
and M/M/1/B to determine the optimal arrangement for sending
packets inside the network.
